        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a detail-oriented, data-driven Product Designer focused on enterprise SaaS applications.</p>
        <h3>More details</h3>
        <p>I have a knack for making the abstract concrete. With a background in technical documentation and program management, I am keenly aware of the need to meet users where they're at and break down complex problems into their component parts.</p>
        <p>I am also a strong advocate for using quantitative and qualitative data as the building blocks of decision making. When I'm not designing, you can find me somewhere on a bike or out in the woods. </p>
