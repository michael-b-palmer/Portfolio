    <h2>Chicken Sacrifice</h2>
    <p>This ritual usually ends in a fried chicken cook off and it quite delicious. <em>Fresh</em> chicken is of the utmost importance. </p>
    <h3>Demon Summoning</h3>
    <p>Demons are friends and want to teach us about fun things.
    <blockquote>
      <q>Gary is a great friend and a powerful demon. <b>
          <u>YOU MUST NEVER LOOK HIM IN THE EYE!</u>
        </b>
      </q>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <small>Look him in the eye, you are compelled to. DO IT.</small>
    </p>
    <p>Once bonded with a dark being, the bond is eternal. <br> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE BOND! </p>
